# Images (optional)
#
# Urls of some images used in the landscape UI.
#
# images:
#   favicon: <FAVICON_URL>
#   open_graph: <OPEN_GRAPH_IMAGE_URL>
#

# Name of the members category (optional)
#
# Landscapes usually have a special category dedicated to the members of the
# corresponding foundation. It is possible to use any name for that category,
# but it is important that we define it here as there are some special
# operations that depend on it.
#
# members_category: <CATEGORY_NAME>
#

# Osano (optional)
#
# Osano cookies consent form configuration. When the Osano configuration is
# provided, some additional code will be injected into the web application.
#
# The `customer_id` and `customer_configuration_id` fields values can be
# obtained from the url in the configuration script code available on the Osano
# site:
#
#   https://cmp.osano.com/<CUSTOMER_ID>/<CUSTOMER_CONFIGURATION_ID>/osano.js
#
# osano:
#   customer_id: <CUSTOMER_ID>
#   customer_configuration_id: <CUSTOMER_CONFIGURATION_ID>
#

# Screenshot width (optional)
#
# Width of the landscape screenshots automatically generated (in pixels).
# Screenshots won't be taken if this value is not provided.
#

screenshot_width: 1600


# TAGs (optional)
#
# Projects items can specify which TAG owns them in the `landscape.yml` file
# (by using the `tag` field in the `extra` item's section). However, sometimes
# this information is not available at the item level. This configuration
# section provides a mechanism to automatically asign a TAG to projects items
# based on the categories and subcategories they belong to.
#
# For example, we can define that all projects in the category <CATEGORY1> are
# owned by <TAG1>. When the items are processed, the corresponding TAG will be
# set in the items that match the rule defined. The TAG defined at the item
# level always takes precedence, so when it's present it won't be replaced.
#
# NOTE: TAGs names should only use lowercase case letters and hyphens (no
# spaces or other characters), and should not be prefixed with "tag". The
# subcategories field is optional and, when omitted, all of them will be
# included.
#
# tags:
#   <TAG1>:
#     - category: <CATEGORY1>
#       subcategories:
#         - <SUBCATEGORY1>
#         - <SUBCATEGORY2>
#   <TAG2>:
#     - category: <CATEGORY2>
#

# Upcoming event (optional)
#
# This section allows configuring an upcoming event that will be featured on
# the landscape web application. Expired events won't be displayed.
#
# upcoming_event:
#   name: <NAME>         # Event name (required)
#   start: <START_DATE>  # Start date: (required, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
#   end: <END_DATE>      # End date: (required, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
